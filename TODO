    The recommended movies should avoid recommending movies the user already likes or has selected as favorite.
    Implement the friends mechanism by inserting friend1=me friend2=other guy when I send the request,
        and friend1=otherguy friend2=me when the other guy accepts
    Implement a limit to how many people/movies can be seen on each table in the homepage. Then a link to see the rest.
